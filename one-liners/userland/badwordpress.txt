printf "\nWordpress sites may seem small from the point of the user, but when there are $(sak-cli | awk '$1~/Active/{print $2}') active plugins installed, as well as a custom theme, a wordpress site becomes a very large and bulky thing that needs a lot of power to run. Just to put it into perspective, I counted the lines of code currently active on your site:\n# find wp-content/plugins/ wp-content/themes/dynamik/ -type f -name *php -exec cat {} \+ | wc -l\n" ; find wp-content/plugins/ wp-content/themes -type f  -exec cat {} \+ | wc -l; printf "\n\nThat's a lot of lines of code. Some of that code may be efficient, and some of it may be inefficient, but in any case, it's a lot, and will make this kind of thing happen. To fix this, please optimize the site by removing some of these plugins, and ensuring that the theme is efficient.\n"
